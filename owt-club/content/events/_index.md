Tech Worker? Out of Work? Recently laid off? Taking a break?

Whatevs! Come and meet, chat and have fun with other tech workers who have
recently found they have a tonne more free time...

No KPIs, no sprints, no MRR targets, no customer calls.

Open to anyone who has worked in any tech company in any role. Devs, Support,
Sales, Marketing, Product, HR and all other departments. Enterprise,
small-business, open-source, government or anything else.

We discuss anything and everything. We can talk shop, industry rumours, job
hunting tips, pitch ideas. But mainly, lets connect outside of
Slack/Email/Stand-ups/Zoom and in-person. They say it's good for you to do it
occasionally, so get ur quota in.
