Hi there!
{{< /lead >}}
I'm Josh Rich. I live in sunny Brisbane in Australia. I am passionate about all
areas of technology. I have written code to support people and customers, and
guided teams to deliver critical projects, built scalable processes and
procedures, mentored, coached and grown individual contributors. Along the way I
have also presented at many well‐known open‐source conferences around the
Asia‐Pacific region. I have run live, hands‐on technical workshops at these
events. I have delivered product training to businesses and groups, both
virtually and in‐person.

Outside of tech, I am learning to play the drums, hack away on a few hobby
projects (check out my GitHub profile!) and enjoy exercising to stay active.
