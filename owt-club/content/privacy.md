# Privacy Policy

OWT Scene is committed to providing quality services to you and this policy
outlines our ongoing obligations to you in respect of how we manage your
Personal Information. We have adopted the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs)
contained in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (the Privacy Act). The NPPs govern the
way in which we collect, use, disclose, store, secure and dispose of your
Personal Information.

A copy of the Australian Privacy Principles may be obtained from the website of
The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner at
[https://www.oaic.gov.au/](https://www.oaic.gov.au/).

## What is Personal Information and why do we collect it?

Examples of Personal Information we collect includes names, addresses, email
addresses, phone and facsimile numbers.

This Personal Information is obtained in many ways including by email, via our
website, from your website, from media and publications, from other publicly
available sources and from third parties. We don’t guarantee website links or
policy of authorised third parties.

We collect your Personal Information for the primary purpose of providing our
services to you. We may also use your Personal Information for secondary
purposes closely related to the primary purpose, in circumstances where you
would reasonably expect such use or disclosure.

When we collect Personal Information we will, where appropriate and where
possible, explain to you why we are collecting the information and how we plan
to use it (see [below](#how-we-collect-your-information)).

Sensitive information is defined in the Privacy Act to include information or
opinion about such things as an individual's racial or ethnic origin, political
opinions, membership of a political association, religious or philosophical
beliefs, membership of a trade union or other professional body, criminal record
or health information. Sensitive information will be used by us only:

- For the primary purpose for which it was obtained
- For a secondary purpose that is directly related to the primary purpose
- With your consent; or where required or authorised by law.

**No sensitive information is collected by OWT Scene at this time.**

## Third Parties

Where reasonable and practicable to do so, we will collect your Personal
Information only from you. However, in some circumstances we may be provided
with information by third parties. In such a case we will take reasonable steps
to ensure that you are made aware of the information provided to us by the third
party.

Your Personal Information may be disclosed in a number of circumstances
including the following:

- Third parties where you consent to the use or disclosure; and
