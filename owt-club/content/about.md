## Who are we?

Tech Worker? Out of Work? Recently laid off? Taking a break?

**This is your scene.**

If you worked in tech, but are now out of tech, then the OWT Scene is your
place. We're fellow tech workers who find ourselves either voluntarily or
involuntarily **O**ut of **W**ork in **T**ech.

## What do we do?

Mainly, the OWT scene is to connect with folks with similar interests. We're not
a career networking group, though that can be part of what being in the OWT
scene does. We're just like-minded people with similar interests building a community.

We discuss anything and everything. We can talk shop, industry rumours, job
hunting tips, pitch ideas. But mainly, we connect outside of
Slack/Email/Stand-ups/Zoom and in-person. They say it's good for you to do it
occasionally, so we get our quota in.

## Who can contribute?

The OWT scene is open to anyone who has worked in tech in any role. Devs,
Support, Sales, Marketing, Product, HR and all other departments. Enterprise,
small-business, open-source, government or anything else.
